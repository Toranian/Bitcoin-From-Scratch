# Bitcoin-From-Scratch
Yes, really.

I am following a textbook on this subject, and this is a collection of notes/examples on the inner workings of Bitcoin.

## Get started
1. To get started, clone this directory. Copy the link from the big green button (you can't miss it) on the top right of the panel.
2. Open a terminal where you would like to put this repository, and type: `git clone [url]`. 
3. Next, we will create a new Python virtual environment. 
  - In the `Bitcoin-From-Scratch` directory, type: `python -m venv venv`. This will create an entirely new version of Python in this directory.
    - If you do not have the Python virtual environment module already installed, install it with: `pip install virtualenv`.
  - To enable the virtual environment, follow this guide: [Activating a Python virtual environment](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv)
  - You will know that you have successfully enabled the virtualenvironment if the `(venv)` text shows up in your terminal. You can also verify it with the following command: `pip freeze`. If you get any output, you have incorrectly enabled the environment and are using your global Python path.
4. Install Jupyter Notebooks with: `pip install jupyter`.
5. Start Jupyter Noteboooks by typing: `jupyter notebook` in the `Bitcoin-From-Scratch` directory.
6. That's it! Enjoy the project! :)
